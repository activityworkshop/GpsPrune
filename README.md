# GpsPrune
GpsPrune is a map-based application for viewing, editing and converting coordinate data from GPS systems.

It's a cross-platform java application, and its home page is at https://gpsprune.activityworkshop.net .

Here on github you'll find all the sources from version 1 to the current version 24.1, and bug reports and suggestions in the form of "Issues".

This branch patches the master branch to make the sources compilable with Java version 8, because it turns out that compiling with Java 11 and specifying a target version of 8 doesn't entirely work.

In the wiki at https://github.com/activityworkshop/GpsPrune/wiki there's the beginning of a translation effort for anyone to contribute.
Currently just a few of the missing texts are online, to see whether it's a workable idea or not.  Please help with these if you can.
Or if you prefer, contributions to the translations can be made using the Translatinator at the GpsPrune home page.
