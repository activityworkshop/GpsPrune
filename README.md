# GpsPrune
GpsPrune is a map-based application for viewing, editing and converting coordinate data from GPS systems.

It's a cross-platform java application, and its home page is at http://gpsprune.activityworkshop.net .

Here on github you'll find all the sources from version 1 to the current version 18.5, and in the wiki at https://github.com/activityworkshop/GpsPrune/wiki there's the beginning of a translation effort for anyone to contribute.
Currently just the Spanish translations are online, to see whether it's a workable idea or not.  Please help with this if you can.
