# super-octo-memory
Super-octo-memory was created on the request of a client who wished to do some things with gpx files that were not well supported by any existing software. To satisfy their needs, it was decided to build on the existing gpsprune software. Under the GNU GPL, the changes must be made publicly available free of charge. Since the client is reluctant to do this, no documentation of the new features is present at this time. 

# GpsPrune
GpsPrune is a map-based application for viewing, editing and converting coordinate data from GPS systems.

It's a cross-platform java application, and its home page is at http://gpsprune.activityworkshop.net .

Here on github you'll find all the sources from version 1 to the current version 18.5, and in the wiki at https://github.com/activityworkshop/GpsPrune/wiki there's the beginning of a translation effort for anyone to contribute.
Currently just the Spanish translations are online, to see whether it's a workable idea or not.  Please help with this if you can.
